*Project Risk Scorecard*

This document is designed to get signoff from stakeholders/teams (column A) for various topics (row 1). The idea is that each stakeholder puts their initials and date in the cell along with color coding it to signify the risk they believe is present based upon what they know at that time. In addition they should color code the cell based upon the risk:

* Green means there is no known risk for that domain/topic.
* Yellow means there is risk, but it is not a something to delay the project over.
* Red means there is a critical issue that must be addressed before go-live.

Any color other than green requires additional information to be provided. This approach was to address issues where someone only looked at one aspect of a project, didn't look at all, or didn't communicate that there were known issues until later.

*Monthly Outages and Emergencies*

This document was designed to track and report out on things that were unplanned. It helps show patterns for applications which need short notice patches, or frequently braeak; even if the business doesn't see that they broke. I have used this to help justify budget to fix systems, or show that a redundancy is working because nobody saw that the primary system went down.
